The LoginTC WordPress Connector is a plugin that allows administrators to quickly add multi-factor authentication to their WordPress deployment.

== Description ==

LoginTC is a unique form of two-factor authentication which adds an additional layer of security to existing password based systems. LoginTC leverages something the user already has: a smartphone. Without sacrificing usability and without the common use of One Time Passwords, LoginTC gets the right users in and keeps the wrong ones out.
